 STAT184 Github Day 1 HW Template
# Introduction
In this project I work with three data sets. The Diamond data set, which can be found in ggplot2 and looks at the dimensions of different classification of diamond. The Penguins data set which is in the library palmerpenguins. And finally is the babynames data set which is found in dcdata and looks at the popularity of names throughout the years.
# Implementation
In this project I worked on 3 data sets in order to extract information from some very large datasets. I used libraries in R to access the data and ggplot2, to plot the data.
# Results 
Overall this project taught me how to use the ggplot package with a purpose. I was able to extract information from the plots and will be able to do it again in future projects. I will include one of the plots I created to show what I am talking about.
